# Sound Synthesiser

This project is a graphical music synthesiser built with Processing that allows users to visualise and manipulate sound waves in real-time. The interface provides controls to adjust volume, pitch, and wave type, offering an interactive experience for sound synthesis exploration.

## Features
* Real-time Synthesis: Generates and manipulates sine, square, and sawtooth waves.
* Interactive Interface: Users can modify volume and pitch using sliders.
* Waveform Visualisation: Users can see the sound wave change as they interact with them.
* Keyboard Controls: User can pause, play, restart, and apply reverb to the sound.

# Setup and Installation
1. Processing: Check you have Processing installed.
2. Sound Library: Install Processing Sound library.
3. ControlP5 Library: Install ControlP5 library.

## Usage
1. Open the .pde file in Processing.
2. Run the sketch by clicking the play button in Processing.

## Controls
Mouse
* Drag: Modify the waveform directly by dragging in the specified area on the canvas/screen.

Sliders
* Volume Slider: Adjusts the volume.
* Pitch Slider: Adjust the pitch.

Keyboard
* '1': Pauses the sound and clears the buffer.
* '2': Restarts the sound with a sine wave.
* '3': Stops the sound.
* '4': Creates a reverb.
* 'a': Change the waveform to a sawtooth wave.
* 'b': Change the waveform to a square wave.
* 'c': Change the waveform to a sine wave.
* 'q': Decrease the volume.
* 'l': Increase the volume.
